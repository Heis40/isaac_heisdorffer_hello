Prompt:
What could be chaged to be more efficient?
AI Response:
Here are a few suggestions to make your HelloWorld class more efficient and maintainable:

Avoid Unused Fields:
The message field is only used in the constructor and not elsewhere. If it's not needed as a field, consider removing it and just use it as a parameter in the method.

Constructor Overloading:
You have two constructors, but the first one does not set age or message. This can lead to age being 0 and message being null. Consider using constructor chaining to avoid code duplication.

Use this() for Constructor Chaining:
This reduces code duplication and ensures all fields are initialized consistently.

Add Getter Methods (Optional):
If you need to access name or age outside the class, consider adding getter methods.

String Formatting:
Use String.format for cleaner output.

Here’s a refactored version:

public class HelloWorld 
{
    private String name; 
    private int age;

    public HelloWorld(String name) { 
        this(name, 0, null); // Constructor chaining
    } 

    public HelloWorld(String name, int age, String message)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age; 
        if (message != null) {
            greet(message);
        }
    }

    public void introduce()
    {
        System.out.println(String.format("My name is %s and I am %d years old.", name, age));
    
    
    public void greet() 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!"); 
    } 
    
    public void greet(String message) 
    { 
        System.out.println(message + ", " + name + "!"); 
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        HelloWorld student = new HelloWorld("Isaac", 21, "Good morning");  
        student.introduce();
        student.greet(); 
        student.greet("Good morning");
    } 
}

Response to assignment AI questions
For AI use, I had used Copilot on the VScode platform. There were no issues with the codes and it ran perfectly. I had used it to see how the code can be run more efficiently. 
The one thing I did change was that the AI had suggested an if loop in the overloaded constructor, which automatically printed the code of the lead overloaded greet method. 
It is printed right above the other code. It seemed very unnatural to me for the output to say “Good morning, Isaac!” with an introduction right after. 
Besides, the code would output the same message at the end, making it redundant. Therefore, I commented out the if loop.However, I did keep the code this(name, 0, null) because it would allow all initializations 
in the three argument constructors, reducing redundancy. 


 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
